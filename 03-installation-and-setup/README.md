# Installation and Setup

## Dependencies

### Docker Desktop

Please install Docker Desktop via their instructions (Install Docker Desktop on [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/), [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/), or [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/).)

### Devbox

All other software dependencies for the course are defined in the `devbox.json` and `devbox.lock` files in the root directory.

Please install Devbox according to their instructions: https://www.jetify.com/devbox/docs/installing_devbox/

Once installed you can run:

```
devbox shell
```

from anywhere in the repo and devbox will use Nix package manager to install a copy of all of the required software in an isolated environment.

### Aliases

I suggest creating the following aliases:

```
k=kubectl
t=task
tl='task --list-all'
```

### Autocomplete:

Setting up tab completion for your shell of choice makes life much nicer:

- kubectl: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/generated/kubectl_completion/
- task: https://taskfile.dev/installation/#setup-completions

## Cluster Set Up

This directory contains configurations and commands for setting up 3 kubernetes clusters. Any of the 3 can be used for most of the examples, with a few exceptions.

### KinD

Runs a kubernetes cluster locally within Docker! Great for testing and development purposes (and doesn't cost any additional money). Nearly all examples in the course can be run within this cluster, with the exception of things demonstrating cloud specific features or exposing services via public DNS.

To start the cluster run:

```
devbox shell # if you haven't already
task kind:01-generate-config
task kind:02-create-cluster
```

### Civo Cloud

Civo cloud offers a simple managed Kubernetes cluster. Their clusters provision quickly and they offer a 1 month, $250 credit for new users: https://dashboard.civo.com/signup.

To create a cluster run:

```
devbox shell # if you haven't already
civo:01-authenticate-cli
civo:04-create-all
civo:05-get-kubeconfig
```

To destroy the cluster run:

```
civo:06-clean-up
```

ðŸš¨ NOTE: If you have deployed additional resources (such as load balancers) that reference the VPC/Subnets/Etc... you may need to manually clean up those resources in order for this command to succeed. You should also verify that you have cleaned up all resources to avoid unwanted costs!

### Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

Google has been operating managed kubernetes clusters longer than any other cloud provider and the polish of the GKE experience shows that. They offer a 90-day, $300 free trial for new users: https://cloud.google.com/free.

To create a cluster run:

```
devbox shell # if you haven't already
gcp:01-init-cli
gcp:07-create-all
gcp:08-connect-to-cluster
```

To destroy the cluster run:

```
gcp:09-clean-up
```

ðŸš¨ NOTE: If you have deployed additional resources (such as load balancers) that reference the VPC/Subnets/Etc... you may need to manually clean up those resources in order for this command to succeed. You should also verify that you have cleaned up all resources to avoid unwanted costs!
