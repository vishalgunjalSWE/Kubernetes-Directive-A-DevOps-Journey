# Section 1: History and Motivation

## 2000s: Traditional Deployment Era

During the 2000s, we experienced what is known as the "Traditional Deployment Era". This period was characterized by:

- **On-premises Deployments**: Companies managed their own data centers or used colocation services.
- **Teams of Sysadmins**: Dedicated teams of system administrators were responsible for provisioning and managing fleets of servers, which was often a labor-intensive and immature process.
- **Bare Metal Servers**: Applications ran directly on physical servers.
- **Monolithic Architecture**: The prevalent architectural style was monolithic, where applications were built as single, indivisible units.
- **Homegrown Monitoring Tools**: Monitoring and managing applications required custom-built tools due to the lack of standardized solutions.

## 2010s: Virtualized Deployment Era

The 2010s marked the transition to the "Virtualized Deployment Era". Key developments during this time included:

- **Cloud Computing**: The advent of cloud computing allowed Virtual Machines (VMs) to be created and destroyed in minutes, providing greater flexibility and scalability.
- **Configuration Management Tools**: Tools like Puppet and Chef became popular for managing infrastructure as code, simplifying the configuration and management of large-scale deployments.
- **Manual Bin-Packing**: Applications were manually allocated to VMs, optimizing resource usage but still requiring significant manual effort.
- **Improved Tooling**: The emergence of better tooling made it practical to manage a larger number of applications and cloud resources.
- **Challenges with Scale**: Despite the improvements, managing large numbers of cloud resources remained a significant challenge.

## 2020s: Container Deployment Era

In the 2020s, we entered the "Container Deployment Era", which brought about transformative changes in how workloads are managed:

- **Workload Orchestrators**: Tools like Kubernetes enabled treating clusters of machines as a single resource, simplifying management and scaling.
- **Standard Interfaces and Utilities**: These orchestrators provided a range of utilities and interfaces to handle:
  - **Efficient Scheduling**: Optimally distributing workloads across instances.
  - **Health Checks**: Monitoring the health and status of applications.
  - **Service Discovery**: Automating the detection of service locations within the cluster.
  - **Configuration Management**: Standardizing the way configurations are managed and applied.
  - **Autoscaling**: Automatically adjusting the number of running instances based on demand.
  - **Persistent Storage**: Managing storage that persists beyond the lifecycle of individual containers.
  - **Networking**: Ensuring reliable and scalable networking between services.
